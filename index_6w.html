        <p class="subtitle">God realm: self-absorbtion and pride</p>
        <p class="description">
          Deva realm is characterized by fixation and meditative absorption,
          physical and mental bliss. You experience breakthroughs, tremendous
          achievements and pleasure. Hope and fear no longer apply to Deva
          state. You experience blissful union (with God, Universe, Nature
          etc.). Everything is beautiful and loving. All is in harmony. However,
          this union is achieved not with God or Universe but with one's own ego
          image. This is an achievement of complete identity with one's own ego,
          elimination of all internal conflicts by ful identification.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          There is no pain and suffering in this state. Fear and anxiety only
          start to creep in after disilussionment, after the realization of
          impermanent nature of the state. The state that was experienced as
          final and absolute. In the end, suffering settles in as the fear of
          loss and the concern for maintenance of this state.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The world is completely ignored in Deva state. Essentially, you are in
          a company with yourself. In fact, the tiniest glimpse of the outside
          world becomes your worst nightmare. There is an impenetrable wall of
          ignorance built around oneself and the world is ignored.

        <h1>Asura</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Demi-God realm: paranoia, jealousy, speed, competitiveness.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The dominant characteristic of this state is paranoia combined with
          extreme efficiency, energy and accuracy. It is associated with primal
          element of wind in Buddhist cosmology. Asuras are extremely
          competitive. They constantly try to achieve something and avoid all
          possible pitfalls without much preparation which requires highly
          developed sense of spontaneous creativity and freedom.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Everything is regarded as a game that needs to be won in the Asura
          realm and everyone is an opponent or an enemy. Extreme achievement
          mentality, speed and agressive strife to overpower and outsmart are
          the main driving forces. There is a constant need to reach and
          maintain complete control, covering all areas. A form of warlord
          mentality takes over the entire life force.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Relationships in the world are marked with constant jealousy, envy,
          intrigue and competition combined with an unbounded ambition. As a
          result Asuras suffer from self-condemnation for not "being the best",
          for not fulfilling the injunction. There is a constant outside threat
          and competition that needs to be outperformed, outmaneuvred,
          destroyed, exterminated. But this is a truly Sysiphean task for the
          number of the competition is legion. The more you get rid of them the
          more they pop up everywhere. This creates an atmosphere of hunt, chase
          and thrill saturated by aversion and aggression where it is you
          against the world.

        <h1>Manusya</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Human realm: selective passion, feeling of inadequacy, desire /
          sadness.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          The central characteristic of Manusya realm is passion accompanied by
          the sense of poverty and the painful awareness of separateness between
          oneself and the object of one's longing. Constant yearning for the
          object of desire is accompanied by the sense of inadequacy and
          weakness. But this longing of Manusya realm is not only to have
          (something) but also very much to be(-come someone). You have an acute
          sense of lack coupled with self-consciousness. And the more refined
          your idea of the object of desire the more unbridgeable the sense of
          lack.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Compared to Deva and Asura realms, Manusya are more intellectually and
          conceptually minded. There is a high thought traffic and constant
          rumination taking place in the back of one's mind, critical
          examination and investigation. Manusya are very selective and
          discriminative, striving for intellectual understanding. But failure
          to grasp object intellectually adds to the suffering from
          dissatisfaction.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In Manusya realm, you are trying to get hold of the object of your
          desire. The distance between you and the object is the foremost source
          of your suffering. But this world is such that the object can never be
          reached. For one, it is but an image of your imagination, (not to be
          confused with hallucination), it is a concept. Even if you take hold
          of an object, the identification with the idea-concept fails. It turns
          out not to be the one you were striving for. Or, what you were really
          admiring has meanwhile shifted, molded into something else, changed
          its shape as well as location. The general dynamic here is that of an
          impossible and tragic love story between you and the world.

        <h1>Tiryagyoni</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Animal realm: close-mindedness, ignorance</p>
        <p class="description">
          Tiryagyoni is marked by blindness to one's own style (or the way one
          behaves, looks, sounds), to the way others see us. As Tiryagyoni you
          do not question yourself. Tiryagyoni are stubborn, predetermined and
          very serious. You would rather follow the established patterns and
          habits and are absolutely unwilling or even unable to look outside the
          given game. Tiryagyoni have uncritical approach towards their goals
          and what they do. Lying and finding excuses for your way of life is
          done with such unquestionable sincerity that it can be easily taken
          for honesty. As a matter of fact you even take pride in your ignorance
          and confusion, you regard it as straightforwardness. This gives
          Tiryagyoni great strength that helps them overpower others, draw them
          into their world.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Your ignorance as Tiryagyoni consists in having one particular aim and
          territory and being disinterested in the rest of the world. Tiryagyoni
          is very conservative, keeps to the familiar and is always suspicious
          of and condemning of the unfamiliar. The primary source of your pain
          is precisely the collapse of the familiar. If the force of the new is
          too strong and cannot be overpowered, Tiryiagyoni switches to
          ignorance, boycotting or playing dead.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Evenyour own self, is ignored, blocked. You are unceremoniously and
          directly dealing with the world like a tank. Tiryiagyoni has no
          self-consciousness. You cannot even recognize yourself in a mirror if
          you were confronted by your self-image. In fact a mirror or a glimpse
          of recognition of your own face is one of your worst nightmares.
          Tiryagiony builds an almost impenetrable wall of ignorance around

          Hungry ghost realm: hunger, possessiveness, poverty mentality.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Preta realm is marked by the sense of lack or more like of an abysmal
          hole. You are obsessively concerned with expansion, acquisition,
          accumulation, consumption. Preta has a tiny mouth and a huge belly.
          They are always hungry for more, since it is impossible for them to
          fill their belly. Actually, it is the insatiable desire itself that
          induces the lack. It not only serves for perpetual crave but it also
          at the same time forms the abyss of lack.

          Your suffering comes from the constant sense of hunger and lack as
          well as dissatisfaction from that which has been consumed. What you
          consume or acquire neither satisfies your craving nor reduces your
          lack. Actually, you may even feel disgusted by it afterwards. Preta is
          a battleground between the conflicting emotions of attraction and
          repulsion. Desire and the frustration of the desire. Your are striving
          to satisfy your insatiable hunger but just as much to get rid of it.
          All your accumulations and takeovers are but a failed attempt to end
          this race. But your hunger can no more be satisfied than a black hole
          can be filled. Preta is slowly eaten by their hunger-desire from
          within. Their story is a story of a heavy addict where an overdose
          seems like the only viable solution.

        <p class="subtitle">Hell realm: hatred, anger, claustrophobia</p>
        <p class="description">
          Naraka realm is permeated by claustrophobic self-perpetuating anger
          and aggression. "Each time the crocodile bites his own tail, he is
          nourished by it; the more he eats, the more he grows. There is no end
          to it." Naraka is suffering from constant pain that is echoed by their
          claustrophobic anger. Your striving is to get rid of this hatred
          inside you, but this hatred is devouring you from inside while also
          being your sustaining life force. There is no escape from it. It is an
          endless pit, black hole. It is a story of terribly failed anger
          management.
